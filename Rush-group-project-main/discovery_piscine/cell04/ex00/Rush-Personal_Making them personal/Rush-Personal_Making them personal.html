<b>UN goal 3-Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages</b>
<br>
The UN goal 3 looks at ensuring health for people, and making sure everyone has access to health and a medical system. This is a big deal, especially in the United Nations, because so many people don’t have access, or can’t afford access to the medical system, or live in such a state of poverty that there is no way they would be able to get the medical help they need. This is a big problem, as every human deserves a right to a medical system, and no one should have to suffer in pain, or even die simply because they were unable to afford the medical care they needed. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Why is this a problem and how does it affect me?</b>
<br>
No matter where you live, or what medical system you have access to, ensuring the health is afforded to everyone is important. Having access to a healthy enviroment allows for strong growth, and reduces death and disease. For countries without access to a medical instiutaion, poverty and death rates increase, and this leads to a lack of a healthy enviroment, and poor health for the next generations to come. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Why am I passionate about this goal?</b>
<br>
UN goal 3 is all about providing health and promoting wellbeing for allx. When I was 11, my sister was diagnosed with AML leakumia, and has spent her life recovering, the side affects of the cancer destroying her life. When I was 14, I lost my grandfather to cancer after a long and hard battle. This year, my father was hit by a truck while on his bike, and almost lost his life. 
<br> 
My point? My family has a history of medical needs, I have seen what happens when family's don't have access to the medical system they need, and I have also seen what happens when people are able to get medical attention. Because of my past, I am able to have empathy towards those who do not have access to a medical system, and this leads me to be passionate about this topic. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Growing from here</b>
<br>
Over the course of the year I will continue to develop the topic of providing medical assistance and promoting healthy lives, and look at finding an end solution to this problem. This is a worldwide problem, and the solution will not be easy to find, it may not even completely exist, or it may be more than one person could ever achieve, but I will try and find a solution to this problem which threatens out lively hood, and prevents proper growth for the new generations.
